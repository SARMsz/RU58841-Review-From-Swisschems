<p>Hair thinning and pattern baldness hit me in my late 20s. I tried shampoos, oils, even finasteride—but none gave the density I wanted. Then I discovered RU58841 powder 5 g from Swisschems. After mixing my own topical solution and testing for 12 weeks, I saw real regrowth along my hairline and vertex. Here’s my full, personal review.</p>

<h2>What Is RU58841?</h2>
<p>RU58841 is a research‐grade androgen receptor antagonist. It binds to receptors in hair follicles, blocking DHT (dihydrotestosterone) from shrinking them. Unlike oral treatments, it’s applied on the scalp—so systemic side effects stay minimal. It’s often called a topical antiandrogen for pattern hair loss.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I ordered 5 g of RU58841 powder from Swisschems (affiliate link below). I mixed 50 mg/mL with 70% ethanol and 30% propylene glycol—my preferred vehicle for absorption and scalp comfort. I applied 0.2 mL twice daily to the thinning areas, using a dropper to target the frontal hairline and crown.</p>
<p>To rank effectiveness, I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hair count:</strong> Monthly photos under consistent lighting.</li>
  <li><strong>Shedding rate:</strong> Number of hairs on my pillow and in the shower drain.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalp health:</strong> Any redness, itchiness, or flaking.</li>
  <li><strong>Density score:</strong> My own 1–10 scale comparing before and after.</li>
</ul>
<p>After 12 weeks, I rated RU58841 from Swisschems an 8.5/10 for regrowth and ease of use.</p>

<h2>My Results and Observations</h2>
<p><strong>Week 4:</strong> Slight reduction in daily shedding. No scalp irritation. Density score up from 3 to 4.</p>
<p><strong>Week 8:</strong> Noticeable baby hairs along the hairline. Shower drain hair count dropped by 40%. Density score climbed to 6.</p>
<p><strong>Week 12:</strong> Thicker coverage on the crown. Overall appearance looked fuller in photos. Density score reached 7.5.</p>
<p>I compared RU58841’s effects to minoxidil—RU58841 acted faster on hair follicles because it directly blocked DHT. Many customers report similar timelines, confirming my findings.</p>
